							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/STDV7776.JPG" alt="" /></span>Hi there, welcome to my portfolio. My name is Hoang Bao Ngan Tran, but you can call me Ngan.</p>
							<p>For me, art is where I can freely express my mind. Exploring the differences across media fascinates me.  I am a complex and detailed person, so I want my work to be as detailed as possible.  Mastering all kinds of material is one of my goals as an artist.  I am studying to be a concept artist because I want to build something extraordinary in this world.</p>
							<p>The world from my view is a colorful one. Most people would assign a color to one specific object, but nothing is unique in my world. It sounded like I am contradicting myself, it’s just how I analyze life. Everything is being influenced by one or more aspects. For example, bees are usually associated with yellow and black for their look, they can also have a hint of orange while pollinating in red flowers. Or like when a pack of lions eating a gazelle, these lions now have a splash of dark red.</p>
							<p>We, humans, are operating under the same system. You “learn” throughout your life, your color is being influenced by other colors. Some people would mix their original color to the color influenced them, some just leave the colors separated. Some might get rid of their original color then become a copy of the color that influenced them. The more colors one has, the more interesting they are in my mind. That is why most of my personal projects are filled with a wide spectrum of different hues.</p>
							<p>When I said I want to build something extraordinary in this world, I really meant it. I want to build a universe that the impossible is possible and the odd ones are the ones with the power. My ambition is to construct my universe using different mediums. From traditional art material such as paints and inks to CGI applications. Images, games, videos, visual novels, I would turn my world into any form.</p>
							<p>Sadly, putting up a new world is not something I can do alone in a short time, and it’s the same for other people that have the same goal as me. I want to help them build their imaginary world. From small stuff like animation to more important subjects such as storyline, I want to be a part of the construction. In fact, it does not matter if the idea is mine or other’s, I just want to create. I want to create the landscape, the buildings, the life in that world. This is the reason I choose to pursue to be a concept artist.</p>
