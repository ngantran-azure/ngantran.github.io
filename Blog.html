							<h3>Blog post 2: <b>I Doubt It</b> Session Report</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="Blog/BLog post 2.png" alt="" /></span> Last Friday, I and my 5 other teammates played I Doubt It. For some of us, it was our first time in the game, some others already knew the rules so it took us quite a bit of time to actually get the round running smoothly.</p>
							<p>The order of players was as followed: Quinlan, Jan, Hannah, Niyana, Grace, and me. I recorded a few rounds after we got the hang of the game. The 4th round of I Doubt It took place as followed:</p>
							<p><b>Round 4th:</b></p>
							<p>The round started with Quinlan putting down a 4 card.</p>
							<p>Jan followed by putting down two 6s and a supposedly upside-down 9, stating he put down three 6s.</p>
							<p>The chance of someone actually having three 6s in the 4th round seems suspicious to me so I halfway doubted it. Quinlan (and Jan) pushed me to call out Jan. And I did. And I was wrong. Jan, in fact, had put down three 6s. I pick up six cards.</p>
							<p>Hannah continues with a 7.</p>
							<p>Niyana follows with an 8 card.</p>
							<p>Grace put down one 9.</p>
							<p>I claim to have one 10.</p>
							<p><b>Round 5th:</b></p>
							<p>This is where the game started to get everyone's mind in the flow.</p>
							<p> Quinlan put down one Jack.</p>
							<p>Jan gets confused and put down a King. We all remind him that his turn is to put down Queens. He takes back the King and claims two Queens.</p>
							<p>Seeing Jan claimed to have both a King and two Queens in his deck, I have my doubt, but last round gave me six cards so I decided not to risk it.</p>
							<p>Since we have two Queens put down, Hannah decided to send two Kings to court the Queens.</p>
							<p>Niyana claims an Ace. The stack of cards is now at 11.  Unfortunately, Niyana does not know what awaits her. Quinlan immediately calls it and he is firm with his doubt. It turns out he is holding all the Aces. We burst out laughing after we heard what Quinlan said. But this is the first alarm to all the other players that we would have to play it safe since people start to hog all four of the same cards. 
								Niyana has to pick up all 11 cards.</p>
							<p>Grace claims to have a 2. Quinlan called again, and this time he knows all four 2s are in Jan's hand.</p>
							<p>I end the round with a 3.</p>
							<p>I claim to have one 10.</p>
							<p>The game continues with me pushing Quinlan to put down his Aces and Jan put down all his 2s. In the latter rounds, the stack of discard cards was 31 until Jan made a miscalculation and called it wrongly. Surprisingly, Niyana is the one who ends the game with a victorious 3.
								It was fun trying to memorize who got what cards and actually communicating with each other to push them to doubt mistakenly. </p>

							<h3>Blog post 1: Internet Arcade</h3>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="Blog/1-30.jpg" alt="" /></span>When I first arrived at The Internet Arcade (https://archive.org/details/internetarcade), I was amazed by the number of arcade games that got lost in time. Being born in a developing country, I was not very familiar with the variety of arcade game titles. I only know the top ones such as Pac-Man, Sonic, Bomber Man World, etc... That is why even though the website includes a lot more games, I tend to search for titles that I'm familiar with.</p>
							<p>The first game that I clicked on was Space Invaders. Sadly, I couldn't play it because of the configuration of my keyboard. I then go on to look for another game that has an instruction. I got lucky with Pacman Club, where they have instructions on how to play it outside of its original arcade box.</p>
							<p>I couldn't feel the difference between playing Pacman on an emulator and playing on the arcade cabinet. I think because I didn't have much experience playing arcade cabinet games growing up, there wasn't much information for me to compare.</p>
