							<p><b>Adobe Premier, Audition After Effects and Clip Studio Paint, 2020</b></p>
							<br/>
							<p><b>Description</b></p>
							<p>I have always thinking that the way I see the world everyday is whimsical and somewhat a bit unique. This is probably what every kids (and some adults) see in their daily life, but this animation is what I "see" every time I go out. </p>
							<p>Sometimes when I walk passed something on the road, either a random bush or a new building I've never seen before, I tend to imagine unrealistic things out of it. I look at bushes and would imagine what happened if these unanimated plants actually have their own thoughts. What would it have been through and listened its whole life until now?
							Other example is during nights that I came home late from school, I have to walk on pretty dark streets. During those walk I tend to think about the dangers that I might encounter. Besides looking out for human predators, I thought about what if in the shades there are monsters that I can't see with my bare eyes. Would these monsters be arrogant or they are actually scared of human?</p>

									<h2>Process</h2>
									<p>Those imaginary thoughts inspired me to make this animation since I want to show others how I view the world. At first, I recorded footages from places I usually go to such as markets, stores, etc... But after much consideration, I chose the view where I walk from my house to my car. This is the view I see everyday and every day it has different little things that makes my day.
										For the protagonist, I designed a character - Ain - who is an alternation of my real appearance.</p>
									<div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Character-Ain.PNG" a href="View.html" /></span><sub>Character sheet of Ain</sub></div>
									<br>
									<p>Initially I wanted to show a morning view and a night view, so I designed Ain into 2 different outfits. The light blue jacket is my morning fit, while I tend to wear hoodie at night. A storyboard was made based on the recorded footages.
										<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Storyboard-1.PNG" a href="View.html" /></span><sub>Storyboard for night scenes</sub></div>
										<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Storyboard-2.PNG" a href="View.html" /></span><sub>Storyboard for morning scenes</sub></div></p>
									<p>After deciding on using just the morning footages, I then edited the footages using Premier and create a place holder frame for the animation in After Effects</p>
									<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/View_placeholder.gif" a href="View.html" /></span><sub>Placeholder in the edited footage</sub></div>
									<br>
									<p>I then exported the placeholder into a .mp4 and hand-drawn animation using Clip Studio Paint. I first did a sketch animation then animated Ain according to the sketch
										<div class="col-8"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/View_placeholder2.gif" a href="View.html" /></span><sub>Sketch and final animation</sub></div></p>
									<br>
									<p>After animating all of the animation using Clip Studio Paint, I combined the edited footage and the animation in After Effects and add in the audio. </p>
